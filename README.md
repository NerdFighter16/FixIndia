Aim of the Project
Our aim is to empower every villager with a simple tool to report local civic issues directly to the concerned authorities like the Gram Panchayat. We want to provide local administrative bodies with a clear, organized, and transparent platform to acknowledge, prioritize, and resolve these problems, strengthening community trust and participation.



Designed for the Heart of the Village
This platform is built with a deep understanding of the issues that matter in our villages and small towns:

Gram Panchayat Integration: Issues can be categorized by department, making it easy for the Sarpanch and Panchayat members to see what needs their attention.

Relatable Issues: From broken hand pumps and flickering streetlights to damaged roads to the mandi and sanitation problems, the system is designed for real-world rural challenges.

Community First: The voting feature ensures that the community, not just a single person, decides which problems are the most urgent.



Problems Faced in Our Villages (Why BharatFix is Needed)
Lack of a Centralized System: Complaints are scattered through word-of-mouth, phone calls, or personal visits, with no single place to track them.

Issues Get Lost: Without a formal record, important issues can be forgotten or overlooked.

No Transparency: Villagers often have no way of knowing if their complaint has been heard or if any action is being taken.

Difficulty in Prioritization: The Gram Panchayat may struggle to identify which issues are affecting the most people and need immediate attention.



‚ú® Features
üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map Reporting: Pinpoint the exact location of an issue on a map.

üì∏ Photo Evidence: Upload a picture of the problem to provide clear visual proof.

üó≥Ô∏è Crowd-Sourced Voting: Upvote issues reported by others to highlight their importance.

üè¢ Department-Based Categories: Issues are automatically routed to the correct department (e.g., Public Works, Electricity).



üîê Secure User Roles:

Citizen: Can report, vote, and comment.

Official: Can access a secure dashboard to update the status of issues.

üìä Analytics Dashboard: A private dashboard for officials to see charts and data on reported issues, helping them make better decisions.



üîß How It Works (For Everyone)
We made the process as simple as possible, so anyone with a smartphone can use it.

Dekho (See a Problem): You see a broken streetlight on your way home.

Batao (Report the Issue): Open BharatFix on your phone. Find the location on the map, write a small note about the problem, and take a photo.

Vote Karo (Vote on It): Your neighbours see the report and can vote on it to show it's important to them too.

Kaam Dekho (Track the Progress): The report goes directly to the concerned department. When an official updates the status (e.g., "In Progress"), you see the marker on the map change color. It's that simple!

üöÄ Future Plans
BharatFix is just getting started. Here are some features we plan to add to make it even more accessible:

Support for Local Languages: Make the app fully available in Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, and other regional languages.

AI-Powered Categorization: Automatically suggest the correct department for an issue based on the description and photo.
